## Overview


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Great start to improve my HTML and CSS skills as beginner. This projects helped me in understanding how to create a card and how to style it.


### Continued development

CSS and styling in general is still a challenge for me. So, Practicing styling is my top priority for now.


### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/ - This is an amazing page which helped me finally understand what syntax to use for each case. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this HTML or CSS.
